Data binding with Recycler view and populate data

Creating the recyclerview with recyclerview adapter is a normal way of populating list. It has several boiler plate code to declare. The alternative approach for this is to reduce the boiler plate code we have the feature called data binding.

It's very easy to integrate and reduce the LOC (Lines Of Code) as much as possible. Need to declare the data binding in build.gradle and you should populate the data with minial amount of code.
